# Copper Linux — handcrafted by 12hrformat
# build.sh — assemble Copper Linux, a from-source Linux distro, into a
# bootable live ISO. No Debian/Arch packages: every shipped binary is built
# from upstream source in this script (kernel, musl, busybox, coreutils and
# friends) plus Copper's own pieces (copper-sh, copper-init, first-boot
# wizard).
#
# Usage:
#   sudo bash iso/build.sh               # everything, in order
#   sudo bash iso/build.sh <stage>       # one stage only
#
# Stages: kernel | base | tools | copper | rootfs | initramfs | iso
#
# Stages share iso/work/, so CI can run them one step at a time and each
# step skips straight past whatever is already built.

set -euo pipefail

# Every stage below stamps itself with a hash of this script, because that is
# where the kernel version and the config flags live. $0 is whatever was
# typed on the command line — CI runs `sudo bash iso/build.sh kernel`, so it
# is the relative "iso/build.sh" — and the cd on the next line stops it
# resolving. Pin it down first.

# ---- stage caching -----------------------------------------------------
# iso/work/ is cached between runs, and the CI cache deliberately falls back
# to the most recent older tree so the expensive kernel build survives an
# unrelated change. That makes a stale stage easy: "does the output file
# exist" is just as true for a tree built from sources that have since
# changed. This build shipped exactly that once — an ISO whose initrd was
# packed from the previous version of iso/live/init, so the overlay
# directories were missing and the first boot died on a valid-looking
# artifact. So every stage stamps its output with a hash of the inputs that
# produced it, and only skips when that still matches. A warm cache buys
# speed now; it can't be wrong.
